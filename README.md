# hr-analysis
This is a short analysis done in Python on an HR dataset.
The goal is to understand why employees leave and how to retain high-performing employees.

The last part of the data analysis employs machine learning to try and predict the next employees to leave the company.

The hr_analytics.ipynb file can be ran in a Jupyter notebook after having downloaded the dataset (HR_comma_sep.csv).
